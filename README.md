## Something more about me

### Hello, I'm Leonardo Balbastro 30 year old , Started in the IT Industry just barely 3 years ago. My first language i learned was Java (not Javascript, just Java) and it was pretty rough to learn it but i succeed in that.
### My Actual job is Support and Maintenance in Legacy Application, we do the proper maintenance, library changes, fixed coding and all required changes that application must need in order to maintain it in actual context.
### Also i'm actually learning the MERN stack (MongoDB , Express, React and NodeJS) in order to change job, im aiming to becoming a fullstack web developer and in order to make that is why i learn this technologies.
### My MOTO is "Never Stop Learning" from Platzi, i don't believe that kind of stuff like "im too old to learn something new" or "old horses don't learn new tricks" and Tech Industry is a reliable example of that (The technologies improves and you need to learn something new always in order to get up to date in the industry).

### This is enough for this presentation, if you have any idea on how to improve this readme, let me know.
